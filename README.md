# 🧠 ZenGradual

**ZenGradual** is a modern, open-source web app designed to help GCSE students organize and revise more effectively. The web app is made for educational purposes, made by a student, for students.

Throughout my educational journey, I saw the lack of useful solutions to my problems, such as a need for a planner or an effective timetable that fits my need. Hence I tried to make something that I would use to help me on my educational persuits. And that led me to creating ZenGradual.

> Plan better. Reflect deeper. Revise smarter.

## My Journey

Before I made *ZenGradual*, I created another Web App, using Flask instead of a more frontend approach. It helped me understand a different approach to creating a web application, which would help me in creating *ZenGradual*.

I started by creating a 'husk', as my friends calls it, a frame for the webapp, then I worked on the pages, with placeholders in place of features. Afterwards, I worked on a log in system, in the form of *authpage.js*, using a very helpful tool called **superbase**.

Then, I worked on a database, supporting XP, Username, Streaks and Subjects. The different data values needed alot of tinkering but it resulted in a fantastic system. It was the first time I worked with an actual database, as I only learnt SQL for a Computer Science test.


Throughout the project, I learnt many pratices that would help me in future projects, such as GUI development and visuals, as well as how to create a good user experience.
